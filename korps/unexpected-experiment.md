# Anise's Unexpected Experiment

<details id="prompt"><summary>KWAP Prompt 1</summary>
You make your way through a hazy morning, your RCG feed
cluttered with last night’s embarrassing escapades and updated
policy feeds about inappropriate fire extinguisher use when you hit
upon a personalized karennet kmail sent to you. A patterned
double-helix border wraps around the message, the contents
summoning you to the R&amp;D section of the Korps regional base to
try out the latest piece of equipment before scaling to deploy in
the field amongst all relevant teams. Apparently you are uniquely
qualified to demonstrate its use: Describe the device (Is it a
weapon, a utility gadget, something to amplify your superpower?) Is
it dangerous and needs further testing or is it refined and safe to
use for its intended purpose? Or is it something else entirely?
Such as a new flavour for a food you’re noted as a connoisseur of?
Write how you use it in a controlled environment, does your
character want to keep it or have feedback they want to give to the
instructors? Did they pay you for your time, and if so, what did
the Korps Scientists give you that enticed you to try out the shiny
new toy?
