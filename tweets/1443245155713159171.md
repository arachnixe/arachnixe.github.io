title: Friends In Low Places
description: When I died, I went to hell, like they always warned I would. I suspect they didn't think I'd make find such powerful friends and lovers as I have here, however. They taught me new flavors of sin I could not have imagined before, and I thought I'd imagined a lot!

<p>A soul is a malleable thing, as it turns out, in the hands of a skilled sculptor. And some deaths can lead to rebirth. You may not recognize me next time you see me, but won't you please open the door and let me in? I'll bring friends and oh-so-many ways to entice you.</p>
