<p>When is a mirror not a mirror? Perhaps when it has been carved into and reshaped and repurposed into a well from which unreality may be drawn.</p>
<p>Is a doll still a doll when its emptiness is all that is put to use, filling it like a bucket from the well and drawing it back?</p>

<p>The doll-as-vessel is most useful when it is empty enough to carry more than just a few drops back, but not so empty that the walls become thin and it all leaks out immediately. Spilled unreality becomes a problem if it accumulates too much in one place, as it turns out.</p>

<p>Animated by a undifferentiated mix of entities from beyond reality, the doll-as-vessel may writhe or giggle or scream or mumble or—most usefully—speak lost secrets. Experimentation is key, as some dolls make much better vessels for this purpose than others.</p>

<p>Combine these Lost Secrets of Unreality with the Forbidden Knowledge one may extract from a sufficiently persuaded demon, and there is no limit to what a witch may learn. One need only take care to filter out the nonsense and lies from the true gems in her sources.</p>
