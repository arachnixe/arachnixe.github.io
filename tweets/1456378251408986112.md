<p>Once they're on the inside of your carefully crafted mental barriers, well, they're a real challenge to get rid of. They'll crawl into all the dark places of your mind and lay their eggs, and then you are dealing with a true infestation.</p>

<p>What about me, you ask? You're right, I've been showing signs of infection for some time now. I achieve some measure of balance by flooding my mind with competing cognitohazards such that the dolls do not dominate.</p>
<p>But humanity? Come now, there's no room left for any of that.</p>
