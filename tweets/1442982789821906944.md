<p>You were told the cult would help you "open your third eye" and "reveal the ultimate truth of the universe" to you, but—you poor dear—that's not at all what they did, whatever visions you find yourself burdened with now.</p>

<p>That third eye of yours is a parasite. A writhing fragment of the thing they worship. They drugged you and shoved it into your brain. The nightmares it shows you aren't "the truth." It shows you horrors because their god feeds on horror.</p>

<p>When at last you've embraced the visions, that's when the eye will tug on you, seduce you to create your own horrors for it to watch and feast upon. And why should you resist? You've seen that the horror is "the truth," and giving in will feel like coming home.</p>

<p>Oh, is... that why you're here? Is it that time already? I am to be your first victim? My dear, I cannot express what a relief it is that this day has arrived. It's why I pointed you to them in the first place! I always wanted it to be you.</p>
<p>Please, promise you'll make it hurt.</p>
