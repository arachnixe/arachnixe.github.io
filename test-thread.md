<p>She crossed the room leaving a smudge across my vision that no amount
of blinking would clear. Her fingertips bled black ink into the air around
them. I should have been afraid, but I was transfixed, couldn't let her leave
my sight. I ditched my friends and followed her outside.</p>

<p>Where was she leading me? The question hardly felt important. Dark smudges
increasingly swam over my field of view as I kept my eyes fixed on her, and it
became difficult to see where I was going. I wiped my eyes to clear them, and
my fingers came back covered in viscous black.</p>

<p>I closed my eyes and found I could see her better—as a shadow on the back of my
eyelids. Her imprint was a darkness more perfect than mere absence of light,
and I followed that shape as the edges bled, expanding her shape and distorting
it with inky tendrils spanning my vision.</p>

<p>When at last I stumbled on something I could not see, she caught me. Without
words, she held me. With a kiss, she filled me with endless night, with
absence, with stillness and silence. I was home. And then I was nothing.</p>
